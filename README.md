# Sanse
A 2D Runner Game.

The Game is based on the events which happened in Kenya during the Pandemic. 
A curfew was set by the government to control the spread of Corona but for some citizens they were unable to meet the curfew time thus they were arrested and even some beaten
by the police. The Player represents the citizen evading the police in the streets of Nairobi. Don't Get Caught! Good Luck!
